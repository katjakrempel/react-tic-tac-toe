# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview
This is an interactive tic-tac-toe game built with React. It stores the history of moves as the game progresses and allows players to go back to previous versions.

The code is based on a beginner-friendly tutorial in the official [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe:). I've implemented some of the suggested improvements:

* For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.

If you have any suggestions for further improvements I'd love to hear them.
